# VISX OI

VISX graph examples to assist with questiosn surrounding data formatting questions.

## Getting Started

1. Run `pnpm install` to install dependencies. If you don't have pnpm then npm should probably work too.
2. Run `pnpm storybbok` to start the Storybook app.
3. Run `pnpm dev` to start the Vite app if that more to your flavor. Each graph has been added to the index page for easy access.
